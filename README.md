# tutor-logger

A SvelteKit application used to record tutoring requests. This application uses Remult for API routes and Lucia for authentication. 

Huge thanks to [this repository](https://github.com/jycouet/remult-lucia), which was a huge help in getting Remult and Lucia to work together. 

### Getting started

To run the application, you can run `npm run dev`
